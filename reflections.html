				<h2>January 1, 2014</h2>
			
				<p>A new year. This last year for me was one of learning to trust myself and overcoming my own obstacles. A year spent becoming me again. I had loose ends to tie up, ducks to put in rows, surgery had and body mended. Along the way I found my passions: coding and community. </p>
	
				<p>Coding is creating. It's building, it's problem-solving, and it can make amazing things. The internet and the world of connected things, has the opportunity to create community in a world where we are discarding the old ways we created community. It gives people ways to connect with like-minded people from all over the world. It gives people ways to connect to their governments in ways that weren't possible 20 years ago. I hope to learn and use my skills to increase community and increase civic engagement on an every-day level.</p>
	
				<p>Learning to code has been a lot of fun. Challenging at times, but that adds to the fun. The past 6 months I have immersed myself in learning these new languages. I've taken online classes in through <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target = "blank">Codecademy</a>, which I highly recommend to anyone wanting to see what it's all about. That whetted my appetite for more. I took local classes in Beginning and Intermediate HTML and CSS, as well as JavaScript, through <a href="http://www.girldevelopit.com/">Girl Develop It</a>. GDI offers affordable classes to women in many cities around the world, usually taught by women. It was a great way for me to dive in without feeling intimidated. I also learned that I learn best in a group environment. I then signed up for a weekend workshop on Ruby on Rails offered free to women by <a href="http://www.railsbridge.org/">The Railsbridge Group</a> here in Seattle. That was a LOT of fun, and I met some amazing women. I took a Git workshop through <a href="http://nird.us/">NIRD</a>, also free, also in Seattle. We have SO MANY resources available to us now.</p>
	
				<p>I signed up with Edmonds Community College for their new <a href="http://www.edcc.edu/pace-it/">PACE-IT program</a> in web development. It's self-paced and online and tuition-free. The program is just starting and has a lot of kinks to be worked out. So far the most valuable aspect has been a mentor that calls weekly and helps with goal-setting and keeping me on track. Hopefully there will be internships available to students as well, which would be very valuable.</p>
	
				<p>I realized that I needed more information than the EDCC program was providing, so I went ahead and signed up for <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/home">Treehouse</a>, which does cost money, but is well-worth the fee for more advanced classes.</p>
	
				<p>My goal for 2014 is to have a job in web development. To work hard and laugh more.</p>
	
				<h3>Happy New Year!</h3>
